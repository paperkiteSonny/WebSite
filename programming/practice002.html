 		<p>Sarver's intention to sell seemed to diffuse tensions on what could have been a very awkward day — and season — for the Suns.</p>

		<p>“I think it was on its way to being a distraction,” <a href="https://www.nba.com/player/1626164/devin-booker">Booker</a> said. “But now that he's chosen to sell the team, I think we can move forward, focus on the goal that's at hand and that's playing basketball.”</p>

		<p>The Suns have been one of the NBA's elite teams over the past two seasons. They made the Finals in 2021 before losing to the Milwaukee Bucks in six games. Last season, they set the franchise record for regular-season wins before a lopsided Game 7 loss to the Dallas Mavericks knocked them out of the playoffs in the second round.</p>
